# Triple_DES-Encryption-Decryption-Period_4-APCS
Triple DES Encryption/Decryption for AP Computer Science Period 4.

We used the Triple DES method of encryption to ecrypt/decrypt certain code segments. 
We consulted this Wikipedia article for Triple DES: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES and used the following article
for DES: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard.

All code was made in Eclipse with Java.
