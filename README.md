# Triple_DES-Encryption-Decryption-Period_4-APCS
Triple DES Encryption/Decryption for AP Computer Science Period 4.

We used the Triple DES method of encryption to ecrypt/decrypt certain code segments. 
We consulted this Wikipedia article for Triple DES informatiom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES and used the 
following article for DES information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard along with this article for
help with the DES algorithim: http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Data-Encryption-Standard

All code was made in Eclipse with Java. 

Thanks for visiting!
